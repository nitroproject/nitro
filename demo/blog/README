The canonical Nitro example.

=== Instructions

To run this example you need mysql installed. You should change conf/debug.rb
according to your installation. If you don't have mysql you can use the sqlite3 or
postgresql adapter by simply changing the corresponding line.

You can start the application with:

./app.rb

or

ruby app.rb

or simply

nitro

If you have pulled the code from the repository, you many want to use the supplied
glycerin.rb script to setup the RUBYOPT environment variable.

  
=== About

This example demonstrates several of Nitro's features:

- Page caching and sweeping
- Multiple rendering formats, automatic conversion (for example append .atom
  to every url for ATOM representation, .json for json representation, etc)
- Normalized controllers. Every object MyObject has a corresponding
  MyObject::Controller.
- Universal templating engine. You can dynamically generate every 
  format supported by nitro. Just add x to the extension, for example
  .htmlx, .cssx, etc. For example dynamic css files can use all
  of Nitro's advanced features (includes, morphing, caching, etc)
